# 🍎 Spark!Bytes — BU CS391 Software Engineering Immersion Project

## 📘 Project Overview
**Spark!Bytes** is a web application designed for the Boston University community to reduce food waste from campus events while helping students and staff access free food.  
Event organizers can post leftover food availability, and users can quickly find opportunities nearby.

This project is developed as part of **CS391 S1: Introduction to Practical Software Development (Fall 2025)** under the BU Spark! Immersion program.

### 🎯 Goals
- Reduce food waste across BU events and organizations.  
- Provide a central hub for free food opportunities.  
- Deliver a secure, scalable, and user-friendly web application.  
- Practice Agile methodologies and collaborative software engineering in a real-world context.

## 🧩 Core Features
- **Event Posting & Management** – Authorized users can post details about available food.  
- **Real-Time Notifications** – Users can be notified when food is available nearby.  
- **User Management** – Secure login, registration, and role-based access control.  
- **Food Availability Dashboard** – Browse active listings by time, location, or type.  
- **Administrative Tools** – View usage statistics, manage events, and handle reports.

## 🔁 Agile Development Process
We follow an **Agile, sprint-based workflow** emphasizing collaboration, iteration, and reflection.

### Sprint Cadence
- **Length:** 1 week  
- **Planning / Review / Demo:** Weekly, in-person at CDS (5:30–6:00 PM)  
- **Standups:** Twice per week via group chat  
- **Backlog Refinement:** Ongoing, minimum once per sprint  

### Tools & Practices
- **Backlog & User Stories:** Managed in Notion with acceptance criteria.  
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** A story is complete when all associated tasks are done and approved by all team members.  
- **Retrospectives:** Identify at least 3 actionable improvements per sprint.  
- **Psychological Safety:** Encouraged through open communication and respect.

## ⚙️ Project Management & Communication
| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|-----------|
| **Primary Communication** | Group text messages |
| **Response Time Expectation** | Within 2 hours |
| **Meetings** | Weekly in-person; two asynchronous text updates per week |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Discuss as a team → escalate to current Scrum Master → escalate to instructors if needed |

---

## ✅ Definition of Done
A user story is considered complete when:
1. All acceptance criteria are met.  
2. Code passes linting and testing.  
3. Peer review and approval from all team members.  
4. Changes merged into the main branch.
